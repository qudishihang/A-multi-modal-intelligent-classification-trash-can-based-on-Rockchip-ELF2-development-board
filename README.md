# A-multi-modal-intelligent-classification-trash-can-based-on-Rockchip-ELF2-development-board
This product is an intelligent classification trash can centered on the Rockchip ELF2 development board (equipped with the RK3588 chip). By integrating three technical modules - card matching, voice recognition, and object detection - it systematically addresses the pain points of complex operation, hygiene risks, and insufficient intelligence in garbage classification. The system uses the CLAHE image enhancement and ORB local feature + color histogram fusion algorithm to achieve rapid and robust matching of garbage cards; the voice interaction is based on the lightweight VOSK model, innovatively applying the Levenshtein edit distance algorithm to calculate the similarity of pinyin, supporting dialect fault-tolerant instructions; the object detection deploys the pruned and quantized YOLOv8 model accelerated by NPU, and realizes real-time inference on the edge through the RKNN toolchain. The hardware integrates the OV13855 camera, MIPI touch screen, and SG90 servo lever mechanism, and reduces hygiene risks through a contactless lid opening design; the electromechanical system achieves multi-modal collaborative control in a compact space. It supports full-scenario applications including education (card teaching), family (voice assistance), and public places (adapting to strong light and noise environments), and reserves the RS485 interface for IoT expansion and solar power supply, providing a replicable "edge AI + electromechanical integration" solution for smart cities.
